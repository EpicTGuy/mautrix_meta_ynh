# Mautrix Facebook Messenger for YunoHost

Matrix / Synapse puppeting bridge for Facebook Messenger, packaged for [YunoHost](https://yunohost.org).
Upstream bridge: <https://github.com/mautrix/meta> (mautrix-meta v26.10, Go / bridgev2).

## ⚠️ Status: looking for testers

This package installs, upgrades, backs up / restores and registers with Synapse correctly (tested on YunoHost 12, Debian 12), but **logging in with a real Facebook account has not been tested yet**.

If you use Messenger and want to help, please install it and report how it went in the issues (login, sending/receiving messages, media, encrypted chats). If it works, I'll propose it to the YunoHost catalog.

Instagram is handled by a separate bridge (`mautrix-instagram`) since mautrix-meta v26.08: this package is for Messenger / Facebook only.

## Install

```bash
sudo yunohost app install https://github.com/EpicTGuy/mautrix_meta_ynh
```

Then, in your Matrix client, open a chat with the bot, send `login` and follow the [official authentication guide](https://docs.mau.fi/bridges/go/meta/authentication.html).

## Features of this package

- Config generated from the upstream example config (v26.10), with a config panel for the main settings: permissions, encryption, import of older chats, display name of Messenger contacts, number of past messages imported in new chats.
- Settings and bridge secrets are kept across upgrades (`config.yaml` is regenerated from the template, the bridge runs with `-n` and never rewrites it, so upgrades don't print its diff).
- Hardened: the binary and `config.yaml` belong to root and are only readable by the bridge user; strict systemd sandbox (`systemd-analyze security` ≈ 1.3); listens on 127.0.0.1 only.
- Bridge permissions handled from the install questions and the config panel (no duplicate entries when the same account is admin and user).
- Double puppeting enabled automatically when a shared `doublepuppet` appservice is registered in Synapse (`/etc/matrix-<synapse instance>/app-service/doublepuppet.yaml`, see <https://docs.mau.fi/bridges/general/double-puppeting.html>).
